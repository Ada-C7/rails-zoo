               <strong>MARK:</strong> Seriously. No registry. We understand that weâ€™re making a big ask. Some of you will be traveling from all over the country and in some cases, the world! <br><br>

               <strong>JANICE:</strong> We get that travel and lodging for an entire weekend is expensive. Both in terms of time <strong> and </strong> money. Mark and I have no desire to add to that burden in the form of a gift. Especially when your presence is all the gift we need. <br><br>
